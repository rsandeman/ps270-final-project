## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to climate change. One idea I have for the project is analyzing the growth of renewable energy sources in Wisconsin and it's impact on reducing carbon emissions.

Potential sources to use: Global Energy Data (BP Statistical Review), U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), or International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)

Another project idea is analyzing global temperatures to highlight the increasing trend of warm temperatures--this may be too simple.
